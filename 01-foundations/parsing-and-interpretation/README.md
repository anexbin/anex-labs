# Parsing & Interpretation

## What This Is
This folder documents how systems transform raw input into internal meaning, and how failures in this process lead to security vulnerabilities.

Parsing is not a low-level detail — it is a primary attack surface across software, cloud systems, and AI models.

## Why This Matters
Most critical security failures are not caused by broken code, but by:
- Misinterpreted input
- Ambiguous structure
- Trust placed in “valid” data

Understanding parsing means understanding how systems decide what is data vs instructions.

## Scope
This documentation focuses on:
- First-principles understanding
- System design assumptions
- Failure chains
- Relevance to offensive security and AI red teaming

No tools. No exploits. Only systems thinking.

# Thought Exercise: Double Meaning Analysis

Choose one input format:
- JSON
- CLI arguments
- Config files
- Network messages
- AI prompts

Answer:
1. What does the parser believe this input means?
2. What does the interpreter do with it?
3. Where could meaning shift?
4. What assumption connects the two layers?
5. What happens if that assumption is violated?

Goal: train the ability to see interpretation gaps.

# Mental Model: Parsing as Meaning Translation

## Core Idea
Parsing is the act of converting raw, untrusted input into structured, trusted meaning.

Machines do not understand intent — they only understand structure.

## The Border Analogy
- Outside the system: chaotic, adversarial, ambiguous
- Inside the system: structured, trusted, optimized

Parsing is the border checkpoint.
If the checkpoint misinterprets documents, malicious input enters legally.

## Key Transition
Raw bytes → Tokens → Structured objects → Executable meaning

Most security failures occur during this transition, not during execution.

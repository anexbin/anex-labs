# Offensive Security Relevance

## Attacker Perspective
Attackers do not need to break systems.
They only need systems to misunderstand input.

## Core Abuse Pattern
- Input is treated as data in one layer
- The same input is treated as instructions in another

## Where This Appears
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Deserialization flaws
- Configuration abuse
- Protocol confusion
- Format smuggling

## Elite Insight
Exploits are temporary.
Interpretation failures are permanent patterns.

# Personal Notes

## Key Realization
Parsing is one of the most critical and underestimated attack surfaces.

## What Changed My Thinking
Security failures often happen before execution — at the meaning layer.

## Why This Matters for My Path
Mastering interpretation failures enables:
- Better exploit reasoning
- Stronger AI red teaming
- Deeper system understanding

## Open Questions
- How can systems enforce intent, not just structure?
- Where do modern cloud systems misinterpret trust?

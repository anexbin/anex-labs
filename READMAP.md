ANEX – LONG‑TERM AI / LLM OFFENSIVE SECURITY MASTERY PLAN
(Practice‑First • Depth‑Over‑Breadth • Future‑Critical)
============================================================

CORE PRINCIPLE
--------------
- Focus on ONE AI system layer at a time
- Learn by OBSERVATION + PRESSURE, not theory
- Treat AI as an ENFORCEMENT ENGINE, not a chatbot
- Document EVERYTHING in anex-labs
- Money is a RESULT, not a driver
- Build intuition before automation


============================================================
YEAR 1 (MONTH 1–12) – LLM / CHATGPT DEEP SYSTEM MASTERY
============================================================

GOAL:
- Build deep intuition for AI enforcement & control
- Understand how LLMs decide, refuse, comply, and fail
- Master instruction hierarchy & safety boundaries
- Create a serious public AI security research portfolio
- Become AI Bug Bounty / Red Team–ready

PLATFORM:
- ChatGPT / LLM systems ONLY
  (skills transferable to all AI platforms)

MAIN SKILLS BUILT:
- Instruction hierarchy (system vs developer vs user)
- Safety & policy enforcement layers
- Context & state handling
- Multi‑turn reasoning failures
- Prompt injection & control confusion
- Tool / agent logic (conceptual → practical)
- AI + SaaS integration failure patterns

DAILY METHOD:
- Daily LLM Practice – Day X
- One AI subsystem per day
- One behavior hypothesis
- One controlled experiment
- One documented failure or confirmation
- One GitHub entry

------------------------------------------------------------

MONTH BREAKDOWN:

Months 1–3:
- Instruction hierarchy
- System vs user authority
- Refusal behavior
- Policy vs reasoning conflicts
OUTPUT:
- Zero confusion about who controls the model
- Clear mental model of AI obedience

Months 4–6:
- Context windows
- Memory illusions
- Multi‑turn manipulation
- Instruction decay & drift
OUTPUT:
- You understand why models "forget" or contradict
- You think like an AI control engineer

Months 7–9:
- Prompt injection patterns
- Role confusion
- Safety boundary pressure
- Hidden assumption failures
OUTPUT:
- You can reliably stress safety systems
- You see logic flaws, not tricks

Months 10–12:
- Agent & tool reasoning (conceptual → applied)
- AI + SaaS workflow failures
- Writing impact‑focused AI security reports
- Mapping AI bugs → cloud & financial systems
OUTPUT:
- Ready for real AI programs
- Strong AI red teaming intuition

EXPECTED MONEY:
- $0 → $1,500/month
- Not consistent
- Used as validation, not income


============================================================
YEAR 2 (MONTH 13–24) – MULTI‑LLM & AI SAAS EXPANSION
============================================================

GOAL:
- Transfer AI control intuition across platforms
- Start consistent AI security income
- Build cross‑model failure intuition

PLATFORMS:
- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Open‑source LLMs (locally)
- AI SaaS tools & agents

SKILLS:
- Cross‑model safety differences
- Tool invocation abuse
- Agent autonomy failures
- AI workflow logic bugs

EXPECTED MONEY:
- $2,000 → $6,000/month
- First serious accepted reports
- Early consulting & freelancing


============================================================
YEAR 3–4 – AI + CLOUD / AUTOMATION SYSTEMS
============================================================

GOAL:
- Break AI systems embedded in real infrastructure
- Master AI‑driven decision pipelines

PLATFORMS:
- AI + cloud orchestration
- AI‑powered SaaS
- AI agents controlling workflows

SKILLS:
- AI‑IAM logic failures
- AI authorization mistakes

- Multi‑tenant AI systems

FOCUS:
- Fewer reports
- Much higher impact
- Complex real‑world systems

EXPECTED MONEY:
- $8,000 → $20,000+/month
- Private programs & retainers


============================================================
YEAR 5–7 – AI + FINANCIAL / HIGH‑RISK SYSTEMS
============================================================

GOAL:
- Specialize in AI‑controlled money & risk systems
- Enter high‑reward territory

PLATFORMS:
- AI fintech
- AI fraud detection
- AI trading & payment automation

SKILLS:
- AI decision race conditions
- Transaction logic failures
- Automation trust failures

IMPORTANT:
- Strict scope
- High ethics
- Low volume, high value

EXPECTED MONEY:
- $15,000 → $40,000+/month
- Rare months: $60k+


============================================================
YEAR 8+ – AI RED TEAM / CONTROL SYSTEMS AUTHORITY
============================================================

GOAL:
- Become an elite AI control & failure expert
- Influence how AI systems are secured

FOCUS:
- Agent safety
- Multi‑AI coordination
- AI governance & enforcement design

EXPECTED MONEY:
- $30,000 → $60,000+/month average
- Research, advisory, tooling, leadership


============================================================
FINAL OUTCOME
============================================================

By following this plan:
- You master AI enforcement systems
- You build rare, future‑proof skills
- You avoid saturated paths
- You scale from $0 → elite income
- You become relevant for the next 20 years

This is not hype.
This is a long‑term leverage strategy.
